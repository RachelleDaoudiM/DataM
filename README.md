DATA MANAGEMENT - HEC Li√®ge
Final project "Inside AirBNB"
Group members : Rachelle DAOUDI, Larissa DUTRA, Edom SILESHI

The analysis and our codes are in the jupyter notebook called "xxx".

To use it, we have to download 3 files avalaible in the repository :
- listings.csv.gz
- neighbourhoods.geojson
- Louvre.png 

The file "listings.csv.gz" is a ZIP file needed to be downloard directly here : http://data.insideairbnb.com/france/ile-de-france/paris/2023-03-13/data/listings.csv.gz because Github does not support its size. The file needs to be open to have the final file "listings.csv" we use in our codes.

After running the first code for data cleaning, we have a new file named "cleaned_listings.csv" that will automatically be created. 

Everything needs to be in the same folder.
